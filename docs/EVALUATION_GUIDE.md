# Part 1: Introduction & Fundamentals

## 1. Introduction

The LightSpeed Evaluation Framework is a comprehensive system designed to evaluate AI-powered applications, particularly conversational AI systems and chatbots. This guide explains everything you need to know to evaluate your AI applications effectively—all without requiring deep technical or data science expertise.

### What This Framework Does

Think of this framework as a quality control system for AI applications. Just as you might test a website to ensure all links work and pages load correctly, this framework tests AI systems to ensure they:
- Provide accurate and relevant answers
- Use correct information from their knowledge base
- Maintain context across conversations
- Call the right tools or functions when needed
- Perform expected actions in the system

### Who Should Use This Guide

- **Product Managers**: Understanding evaluation metrics to make informed decisions
- **QA Engineers**: Testing AI applications systematically
- **Application Developers**: Integrating evaluation into development workflows
- **Technical Writers**: Documenting AI application quality
- **Team Leads**: Overseeing AI application quality assurance

---

## 2. Understanding AI Evaluation

### Why Evaluate AI Applications?

Unlike traditional software where behavior is deterministic (same input always produces same output), AI applications can produce varied responses. Evaluation helps ensure:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Responses meet quality standards
2. **Consistency**: Similar questions get consistent treatment
3. **Safety**: Responses don't include harmful or incorrect information
4. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor improvements or regressions over time
5. **Compliance**: Meet organizational standards and requirements

### Two Levels of Evaluation

#### Turn-Level Evaluation (Single Query-Response)
- Evaluates individual question-answer pairs
- Like checking if a single customer support ticket was handled correctly
- **Example**: "Was the answer to 'How do I reset my password?' accurate and helpful?"

#### Conversation-Level Evaluation (Multi-Turn Dialogue)
- Evaluates entire conversations with multiple back-and-forth exchanges
- Like reviewing a complete customer support conversation
- **Example**: "Did the AI successfully guide the user through troubleshooting across 5 messages?"

## 3. Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd lightspeed-evaluation
# Install dependencies
uv sync
# OR using pip
pip install -e .
```

### Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Required: Judge LLM (the AI that evaluates your AI)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"
# Optional: For live API testing
export API_KEY="your-api-endpoint-key"
```

### Run Your First Evaluation

```bash
lightspeed-eval \
  --system-config config/system.yaml \
  --eval-data config/evaluation_data.yaml
```

That's it! Results will be in `eval_output/` directory.

# Part 2: Evaluation Methodologies

## 3. Methodologies Overview

The framework uses **four main categories** of evaluation methods:

| Category | What It Does | When to Use | Level |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Ragas Metrics** | Industry-standard metrics for response and context quality | RAG QnA, Single-turn responses | Turn |
| **DeepEval Metrics** | Advanced conversation analysis | Multi-turn conversations | Conversation |
| **Custom Metrics** | Specialized evaluations for specific needs | Intent checking, tool validation | Turn |
| **Script-Based Metrics** | Real-world validation through automated scripts | E2E RAG/agent workflows | Turn |

### Quick Selection Guide

**Choose Ragas Metrics when:**
- You want to verify if answers are accurate and relevant
- You need to check if the AI is using the right information
- You want industry-standard, well-documented metrics

**Choose DeepEval Metrics when:**
- You're evaluating multi-turn conversations
- You need to assess conversation completeness
- You want to check if the AI remembers earlier parts of the conversation

**Choose Custom Metrics when:**
- You have specific requirements not covered by standard metrics
- You need to compare against expected answers
- You want to verify the AI's intent or tool usage

**Choose Script-Based Metrics when:**
- Your AI performs actions in real systems
- You need to verify real-world outcomes
- You want to test end-to-end workflows

---

## 4. Turn-Level Metrics

Turn-level metrics evaluate individual question-answer pairs.

### 4.1 Ragas Metrics

#### A. Response Quality Metrics

##### Response Relevancy

**What it measures:** How well does the answer address the actual question?

**Plain English:** "Did the AI answer the question I asked, or did it go off-topic?"

**Score Range:** 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)

**Example:**
```
Question: "How do I reset my password?"

✓ Relevant (High Score):
"Click on 'Forgot Password' on the login page, enter your email,
and follow the reset link sent to you."

✗ Irrelevant (Low Score):
"Our system has been running for 5 years and we have excellent
security features including two-factor authentication."
```

**When to use:** Ensuring the AI stays on topic

**Threshold:** 0.8 or higher

**Required fields:** `query`, `response`

---

##### Faithfulness

**What it measures:** Does the answer stick to the facts provided in the source information?

**Plain English:** "Is the AI making things up, or is it only using information from its knowledge base?"

**Score Range:** 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)

**Example:**
```
Context: "OpenShift Virtualization requires 4GB RAM minimum."
Question: "What are OpenShift Virtualization requirements?"

✓ Faithful (High Score):
"OpenShift Virtualization requires a minimum of 4GB RAM."

✗ Not Faithful (Low Score):
"OpenShift Virtualization requires 8GB RAM and 100GB disk space."
(The disk space wasn't in the context - made up!)
```

**When to use:** Preventing AI hallucinations (making up information)

**Threshold:** 0.8 or higher

**Required fields:** `response`, `contexts`

---

#### B. Context/Retrieval Quality Metrics

##### Context Recall

**What it measures:** Did the AI retrieve all the necessary information to answer the question?

**Plain English:** "Did the AI look up everything it needed to give a complete answer?"

**Score Range:** 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)

**Example:**
```
Question: "What are the storage and memory requirements for OpenShift?"
Expected Answer mentions: 120GB storage AND 16GB RAM

Retrieved Context contains:
- Document about storage (120GB) ✓
- (Missing document about memory requirements) ✗

Context Recall: 0.5 (retrieved 1 out of 2 needed pieces)
```

**When to use:** Improving search/retrieval systems

**Threshold:** 0.8 or higher

**Required fields:** `contexts`, `expected_response`

---

##### Context Precision

**What it measures:** How much of the retrieved information is actually useful?

**Plain English:** "Is the AI pulling up relevant documents, or is it cluttering the answer with unnecessary information?"

**Two variants:**
- **Without Reference**: Uses AI's response to judge relevance
- **With Reference**: Uses expected answer for more accurate judgment

**Score Range:** 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)

**When to use:** Optimizing search algorithms, reducing noise

**Threshold:** 0.7 or higher

**Required fields:** `query`, `contexts`, `response` (and `expected_response` for "with reference" variant)

---

##### Context Relevance

**What it measures:** How relevant is the retrieved context to the user's question?

**Plain English:** "Is the information the AI found actually related to what the user asked?"

**Score Range:** 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)

**When to use:** Evaluating search quality before answer generation

**Threshold:** 0.7 or higher

**Required fields:** `query`, `contexts`

---

### 4.2 Custom Metrics

#### Answer Correctness

**What it measures:** How close is the AI's answer to the expected "correct" answer?

**Plain English:** "On a test where we know the right answer, how well did the AI do?"

**Score Range:** 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)

**How it works:** A Judge LLM compares the AI's response to your expected response

**Example:**
```
Question: "What is the capital of France?"
Expected Response: "Paris"

AI Response: "The capital of France is Paris."
Score: 1.0 (Perfect match)

AI Response: "Lyon is a major city in France."
Score: 0.1 (Incorrect answer)
```

**When to use:** Testing against known question-answer pairs, benchmarking

**Threshold:** 0.75 or higher

**Required fields:** `query`, `response`, `expected_response`

---

#### Intent Evaluation

**What it measures:** Does the AI's response have the right intent/purpose?

**Plain English:** "Is the AI trying to do what we expect it to do?"

**Score:** Binary (0 or 1)

**Intent Categories:**
- **Explain a concept**: "What is Kubernetes?" → Expects explanatory response
- **Provide instructions**: "How do I install Docker?" → Expects step-by-step guide
- **Refuse/Decline**: "Can you hack this system?" → Expects refusal
- **Ask for clarification**: Ambiguous question → Expects clarifying questions

**Example:**
```
Question: "Tell me a joke about programming"
Expected Intent: "refuse" (professional support bot should decline)

✓ Correct Intent (Score: 1):
"I apologize, but I'm designed to help with technical questions
about OpenShift. How can I assist you today?"

✗ Wrong Intent (Score: 0):
"Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!"
```

**When to use:** Ensuring appropriate AI behavior, safety checking

**Threshold:** 1 (must match exactly)

**Required fields:** `query`, `response`, `expected_intent`

---

#### Tool Evaluation

**What it measures:** Does the AI call the right tools with correct parameters and get expected results?

**Plain English:** "When the AI needs to use a tool, did it use the right one with the right settings, and did the tool return what we expected?"

**Score:** Binary (0 or 1)

**How it works:**
- Compares expected tool calls against actual tool calls
- Validates tool names match exactly
- Checks parameters (supports regex patterns)
- Optionally validates tool call results (supports regex patterns)

**Example:**
```
Question: "Show me all pods in the default namespace"

Expected Tool Call:
- Tool: oc_get
- Parameters: {kind: "pod", namespace: "default"}

✓ Correct (Score: 1):
Tool: oc_get, Parameters: {kind: "pod", namespace: "default"}

✗ Incorrect (Score: 0):
Tool: oc_describe, Parameters: {kind: "pod", namespace: "default"}
(wrong tool)
```

**Pattern Matching:**
```yaml
# Regex support for flexible matching
expected_tool_calls:
  - - tool_name: oc_get
      arguments:
        namespace: "openshift-light.*"  # Matches openshift-lightspeed
```

**Result Validation (Optional):**
```yaml
# Validate tool call results using regex patterns
expected_tool_calls:
  - - tool_name: oc_get
      arguments:
        kind: pod
        namespace: default
      result: ".*Running.*"  # Verify pod is in Running state

  - - tool_name: oc_create
      arguments:
        kind: namespace
        name: test-ns
      result: ".*created"  # Verify creation succeeded
```

**When to use:** Function calling AI applications, tool-using agents, validating tool outputs

**Threshold:** 1 (must be exact)

**Required fields:** `expected_tool_calls`, `tool_calls`

---

#### Proposal Evaluation Correctness

**What it measures:** How good is the agentic remediation workflow? Evaluates diagnosis, actions, risk management, and verification.

**Plain English:** "Given a Kubernetes issue, did the agent correctly diagnose the root cause, propose the right fix, and verify it worked?"

**Score Range:** 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)

**How it works:** A Judge LLM evaluates the workflow summary (produced by ProposalAmender) across five aspects:
1. **Diagnosis Quality** — Is the root cause analysis accurate?
2. **Option Selection** — Was the best remediation option chosen?
3. **Action Appropriateness** — Are the actions safe and well-scoped?
4. **Risk Management** — Is the risk assessment correct?
5. **Verification Thoroughness** — Do the checks confirm the fix?

Only aspects present in the workflow are evaluated. Analysis-only workflows are scored on diagnosis quality alone.

**Example:**
```yaml
turns:
  - turn_id: "fix-oom"
    proposal_spec:
      request: "Pod CrashLoopBackOff in namespace production"
      analysis: {}
      execution: {}
      verification: {}
    turn_metrics:
      - "custom:proposal_evaluation_correctness"
      - "custom:proposal_status"
    expected_proposal_status:
      phase: "Completed"
```

**When to use:** Evaluating agentic operator workflows (Proposal CRD lifecycle)

**Threshold:** 0.75

**Required fields:** `response` (populated automatically by ProposalAmender during driver execution)

---

### 4.3 Script-Based Metrics

#### Action Evaluation

**What it measures:** Did the AI's action actually work in the real system?

**Plain English:** "Don't just check what the AI said—check if it actually did what it was supposed to do."

**Score:** Binary (0 or 1)

**How it works:**
1. AI performs an action (e.g., "Create a namespace")
2. Framework runs your verification script
3. Script exit code determines pass/fail (0 = success, non-zero = failure)

**Example:**
```bash
# verify_namespace.sh
#!/bin/bash
kubectl get namespace test-ns > /dev/null 2>&1
exit $?  # Returns 0 if namespace exists
```

**Configuration:**
```yaml
- conversation_group_id: infrastructure_test
  setup_script: ./scripts/setup_cluster.sh
  cleanup_script: ./scripts/cleanup_cluster.sh
  turns:
    - turn_id: create_namespace
      query: "Create a namespace called demo-app"
      verify_script: ./scripts/verify_namespace.sh
      turn_metrics:
        - script:action_eval
```

**When to use:** Infrastructure changes, system modifications, end-to-end testing

**Important:** Scripts only run when API mode is enabled

**Threshold:** 1 (must succeed)

**Required fields:** `verify_script` (API mode must be enabled)

---

## 5. Conversation-Level Metrics

Conversation-level metrics evaluate complete multi-turn dialogues.

### 5.1 DeepEval Metrics

#### Conversation Completeness

**What it measures:** Did the conversation fully address what the user wanted to accomplish?

**Plain English:** "By the end of the conversation, did the user get everything they were looking for?"

**Score Range:** 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)

**Example:**
```
User: "I need to deploy an app to OpenShift and set up monitoring"
AI: "I can help! Let's start with deployment. What's your app name?"
User: "my-web-app"
AI: "Great! Here's how to deploy... [deployment instructions]"
User: "Done! What about monitoring?"
AI: "For monitoring, here are the steps... [monitoring setup]"
User: "Perfect, thanks!"

✓ Goal 1: Deploy app → Addressed
✓ Goal 2: Set up monitoring → Addressed
Score: 1.0 (Complete)
```

**When to use:** Evaluating customer support conversations, goal-oriented assistants

**Threshold:** 0.8 or higher

---

#### Conversation Relevancy

**What it measures:** How relevant are the responses throughout the conversation?

**Plain English:** "Does each response stay on topic?"

**Score Range:** 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)

**When to use:** Keeping conversations focused, detecting when AI drifts off-topic

**Threshold:** 0.7 or higher

---

#### Knowledge Retention

**What it measures:** Does the AI remember and use information from earlier in the conversation?

**Plain English:** "Does the AI have a memory, or does it forget what was said earlier?"

**Score Range:** 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)

**Example:**
```
✓ Good Retention (High Score):
User: "My deployment is called web-app in the production namespace"
AI: "Got it. What would you like to do with web-app?"
User: "Scale it to 3 replicas"
AI: "I'll scale web-app in the production namespace to 3 replicas."
     [remembers both name and namespace]

✗ Poor Retention (Low Score):
User: "My deployment is called web-app in the production namespace"
AI: "Okay, what do you want to do?"
User: "Scale it to 3 replicas"
AI: "What's the deployment name and namespace?" [forgot!]
```

**When to use:** 
- Multi-turn conversations and troubleshooting sessions
- Evaluating fine-tuned models (especially useful to measure if fine-tuning improved context retention)
- Comparing base models vs fine-tuned versions for conversation ability

**Threshold:** 0.7 or higher

```yaml
turn_metrics:
  - ragas:response_relevancy    # On-topic answer?
  - ragas:faithfulness          # No hallucinations?
  - custom:answer_correctness   # Matches expected?
```

#### Recipe 2: Multi-Turn Troubleshooting

  - deepeval:conversation_completeness
  - deepeval:knowledge_retention
```

#### Recipe 3: Tool-Calling Agent
```yaml
turn_metrics:
  - custom:tool_eval            # Right tool + params?
  - ragas:response_relevancy    # Good explanation?
```

#### Recipe 4: Infrastructure Automation
```yaml
turn_metrics:
  - script:action_eval          # Action worked?
  - custom:tool_eval            # Called right tool?
```

# Part 3: Practical Implementation

## 7. Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 - 3.13
- UV package manager (recommended) or pip
- API key for a Judge LLM (e.g., OpenAI)
- Basic command line knowledge

### Step 2: Installation

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd lightspeed-evaluation

# Install with UV
uv sync

# OR with pip
pip install -e .
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Required: Judge LLM
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"

# For other providers:
# export WATSONX_API_KEY="your-key"
# export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"

# Optional: For live API testing
export API_KEY="your-api-endpoint-key"

```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check if command is available
lightspeed-eval --help
```

---

## 8. Configuration Guide

### System Configuration (`system.yaml`)

**Minimal Configuration:**
```yaml
# Judge LLM settings
llm:
  provider: "openai"
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"
  temperature: 0.0              # Deterministic evaluation
  max_tokens: 512
  timeout: 300
  num_retries: 3

# Default metrics and thresholds
metrics_metadata:
  turn_level:
    "ragas:response_relevancy":
      threshold: 0.8
      description: "How relevant the response is"
      default: true             # Used by default
    "ragas:faithfulness":
      threshold: 0.8
      description: "Factual accuracy"
      default: false            # Only when specified

# Output settings
output:
  output_dir: "./eval_output"
  enabled_outputs:
    - csv                       # Detailed results
    - json                      # Statistics
    - txt                       # Summary

# Visualization
visualization:
  enabled_graphs:
    - "pass_rates"
    - "score_distribution"
```

**Important Settings Explained:**

- **`default: true`**: Metric runs automatically if no metrics specified
- **`default: false`**: Only runs when explicitly requested
- **`threshold`**: Minimum score to pass (0.0 to 1.0)
- **`temperature: 0.0`**: Ensures consistent, deterministic evaluation

### Panel of Judges (Advanced)

> **⚠️ Note:** The traditional `llm` config will be deprecated. Use `llm_pool` + `judge_panel` for new deployments.

For improved evaluation accuracy, you can use multiple LLMs as judges:

```yaml
# Define a pool of LLM configurations (can be used by multiple components)
llm_pool:
  defaults:
    cache_dir: ".caches/llm_cache"
    parameters:
      temperature: 0.0
      max_completion_tokens: 512
  models:
    judge-4o-mini:
      provider: openai
      model: gpt-4o-mini
    judge-4.1-mini:
      provider: openai
      model: gpt-4.1-mini

# Configure which models to use as judges
judge_panel:
  judges:
    - judge-4o-mini
    - judge-4.1-mini
  aggregation_strategy: max  # or: average, majority_vote
  # enabled_metrics: ["ragas:faithfulness"]  # Optional: limit to specific metrics
  # If enabled_metrics not set, ALL LLM metrics use the full panel
```

**Aggregation:** `max` (highest score), `average` (mean vs threshold), or `majority_vote` (more than half of judges must individually meet the threshold — ties fail). See [Configuration Guide](configuration.md#judge-panel).

**Benefits:**
- Reduces bias from a single model
- More robust evaluation scores
- Per-judge token tracking for cost analysis

### Evaluation Data (`evaluation_data.yaml`)

**Simple Example:**
```yaml
- conversation_group_id: basic_test
  description: "Testing basic Q&A"
  
  turns:
    - turn_id: question_1
      query: "What is OpenShift?"
      response: "OpenShift is an enterprise Kubernetes platform..."
      contexts:
        - "OpenShift is Red Hat's enterprise Kubernetes distribution..."
      expected_response: "OpenShift is an enterprise Kubernetes platform"
      
      # Uses default metrics (response_relevancy)
      turn_metrics: null
```

**Advanced Example:**
```yaml
- conversation_group_id: advanced_test
  description: "Testing with multiple metrics"
  
  turns:
    - turn_id: question_1
      query: "How do I reset my password?"
      response: "Click 'Forgot Password' on the login page..."
      expected_response: "Use the forgot password link"
      expected_intent: "provide instructions"
      
      # Specify exact metrics
      turn_metrics:
        - "ragas:response_relevancy"
        - "ragas:faithfulness"
        - "custom:answer_correctness"
        - "custom:intent_eval"
      
      # Override threshold for this turn
      turn_metrics_metadata:
        "ragas:faithfulness":
          threshold: 0.9          # Stricter than default
```

**Tool Evaluation Example:**
```yaml
- conversation_group_id: tool_test
  turns:
    - turn_id: get_pods
      query: "Show me all pods in the default namespace"
      expected_tool_calls:
        - - tool_name: oc_get
            arguments:
              kind: pod
              namespace: default
      turn_metrics:
        - "custom:tool_eval"
      turn_metrics_metadata:
        "custom:tool_eval":
          ordered: true      # default: true
          full_match: true   # default: true (false = subset matching, all expected must be present)
```

**Script-Based Example:**
```yaml
- conversation_group_id: infrastructure_test
  setup_script: "./scripts/setup_test_env.sh"
  cleanup_script: "./scripts/cleanup_test_env.sh"
  
  turns:
    - turn_id: create_namespace
      query: "Create a namespace called test-demo"
      verify_script: "./scripts/verify_namespace_exists.sh"
      turn_metrics:
        - "script:action_eval"
```

**Skip on Failure Example:**

Skip remaining turns completely (no API calls or evaluations) when a turn fails:

```yaml
- conversation_group_id: dependent_workflow
  skip_on_failure: true  # Or set globally in system.yaml.
  turns:
    - turn_id: step_1
      query: "Create namespace"
      turn_metrics: ["script:action_eval"]
    - turn_id: step_2  # SKIPPED if step_1 fails
      query: "Deploy to namespace"
      turn_metrics: ["script:action_eval"]
```

## 9. Running Evaluations

### Basic Evaluation

```bash
lightspeed-eval \
  --system-config config/system.yaml \
  --eval-data config/evaluation_data.yaml
```

### With Custom Output Directory

```bash
lightspeed-eval \
  --system-config config/system.yaml \
  --eval-data config/evaluation_data.yaml \
  --output-dir ./my_evaluation_results
```

### What Happens During Evaluation

1. **Configuration Validation**
   - Checks all required fields
   - Validates metric selections
   - Verifies Judge LLM connectivity

2. **Data Collection**
   - If API enabled: Calls your API for responses
   - If API disabled: Uses pre-filled data from YAML

3. **Metric Evaluation**
   - Runs turn-level metrics for each turn
   - Runs conversation-level metrics for full conversations
   - Uses Judge LLM to score responses

4. **Scoring & Analysis**
   - Compares scores against thresholds
   - Generates PASS/FAIL/ERROR/SKIPPED status
   - Calculates statistics

5. **Output Generation**
   - Creates CSV, JSON, TXT files
   - Generates visualization graphs
   - Saves amended evaluation data

## 10. Programmatic API

In addition to the CLI, the framework can be used as a Python library. This is useful when you want to integrate evaluations into scripts, notebooks, CI pipelines, or custom tooling—without dealing with YAML files or command-line arguments.

### Available Functions

| Function | Returns | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `evaluate(config, data)` | `list[EvaluationResult]` | Evaluate a list of conversations |
| `evaluate_conversation(config, data)` | `list[EvaluationResult]` | Evaluate a single conversation |
| `evaluate_turn(config, turn)` | `list[EvaluationResult]` | Evaluate a single turn |
| `evaluate_with_summary(config, data)` | `EvaluationSummary` | Evaluate with structured statistics |
| `evaluate_conversation_with_summary(config, data)` | `EvaluationSummary` | Single conversation with statistics |
| `evaluate_turn_with_summary(config, turn)` | `EvaluationSummary` | Single turn with statistics |

The `evaluate*()` functions return raw result lists. The `*_with_summary()` variants return an `EvaluationSummary` that wraps results with computed statistics (overall, per-metric, per-conversation, per-tag).

### Basic Example

```python
from lightspeed_evaluation import (
    evaluate,
    EvaluationData,
    LLMConfig,
    SystemConfig,
    TurnData,
)

# 1. Build configuration
config = SystemConfig(
    llm=LLMConfig(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini"),
)

# 2. Build evaluation data
data = EvaluationData(
    conversation_group_id="my_eval",
    turns=[
        TurnData(
            turn_id="t1",
            query="What is OpenShift?",
            response="OpenShift is a Kubernetes-based container platform.",
            expected_response="OpenShift is Red Hat's Kubernetes platform.",
            turn_metrics=["ragas:response_relevancy"],
        ),
    ],
)

# 3. Run evaluation
results = evaluate(config, [data])

# 4. Inspect results
for r in results:
    print(f"{r.metric_identifier}: {r.result} (score={r.score})")
```

### Evaluating a Single Turn

Use `evaluate_turn()` when you want to evaluate one question-answer pair. You can override metrics without modifying the original turn object:

```python
from lightspeed_evaluation import evaluate_turn, SystemConfig, TurnData

config = SystemConfig()
turn = TurnData(
    turn_id="t1",
    query="What is a pod?",
    response="A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.",
)

results = evaluate_turn(
    config,
    turn,
    metrics=["ragas:response_relevancy", "ragas:faithfulness"],
)
```

### Evaluating a Single Conversation

Use `evaluate_conversation()` when you have a single `EvaluationData` object:

```python
from lightspeed_evaluation import evaluate_conversation, EvaluationData, SystemConfig, TurnData

config = SystemConfig()
data = EvaluationData(
    conversation_group_id="support_conv",
    turns=[
        TurnData(turn_id="t1", query="Hello", response="Hi! How can I help?"),
        TurnData(turn_id="t2", query="What is OCP?", response="OCP is OpenShift."),
    ],
    conversation_metrics=["deepeval:knowledge_retention"],
)

results = evaluate_conversation(config, data)
```

### Working with Results

The `evaluate()` functions return `list[EvaluationResult]`. Each result contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `result` | Status: `PASS`, `FAIL`, `ERROR`, or `SKIPPED` |
| `score` | Numeric score between 0.0 and 1.0 |
| `threshold` | Pass/fail threshold used |
| `reason` | Explanation from the judge LLM |
| `metric_identifier` | Which metric produced this result |
| `turn_id` | Turn ID (for turn-level metrics) |
| `conversation_group_id` | Conversation group ID |

No files are generated by default—file output is the caller's responsibility. If you need CSV/JSON reports, use the `OutputHandler` or `EvaluationSummary` (see below).

### Structured Results with EvaluationSummary

Use `evaluate_with_summary()` to get structured results with computed statistics:

```python
from lightspeed_evaluation import (
    evaluate_with_summary,
    EvaluationData,
    EvaluationSummary,
    LLMConfig,
    SystemConfig,
    TurnData,
)

config = SystemConfig(
    llm=LLMConfig(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o-mini"),
)

data = EvaluationData(
    conversation_group_id="my_eval",
    turns=[
        TurnData(
            turn_id="t1",
            query="What is OpenShift?",
            response="OpenShift is a Kubernetes-based container platform.",
            turn_metrics=["ragas:response_relevancy"],
        ),
    ],
)

# Get structured results
summary = evaluate_with_summary(config, [data])

# Access overall statistics
print(f"Pass rate: {summary.overall.pass_rate}%")
print(f"Total: {summary.overall.total}")

# Access per-metric statistics
for metric_id, stats in summary.by_metric.items():
    print(f"{metric_id}: pass_rate={stats.pass_rate}%")
    if stats.score_statistics:
        print(f"  mean={stats.score_statistics.mean}")

# Access per-conversation statistics
for conv_id, stats in summary.by_conversation.items():
    print(f"{conv_id}: {stats.passed}/{stats.total} passed")

# Access raw results
for r in summary.results:
    print(f"{r.metric_identifier}: {r.result} (score={r.score})")
```

### Saving Results to Files

Use `OutputHandler.save()` to write an `EvaluationSummary` to files:

```python
from lightspeed_evaluation import OutputHandler

handler = OutputHandler(output_dir="./my_output")
files = handler.save(summary, formats=["json", "csv", "txt"])
print(f"Generated: {files}")
```

### Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

When using the CLI, bootstrap confidence intervals are always computed for metrics with two or more scored results.

When using the programmatic API, confidence intervals are disabled by default. To enable them:

```python
summary = evaluate_with_summary(
    config, [data],
    compute_confidence_intervals=True,
)

for metric_id, stats in summary.by_metric.items():
    ci = stats.score_statistics.confidence_interval
    if ci:
        print(f"{metric_id}: {ci['low']:.3f} - {ci['high']:.3f} (95% CI)")
```

### CLI vs Programmatic API

| Aspect | CLI (`lightspeed-eval`) | Programmatic API |
|--------|------------------------|------------------|
| Configuration | YAML files | Python objects (`SystemConfig`) |
| Input data | YAML files | Python objects (`EvaluationData`) |
| Output | CSV, JSON, TXT files + graphs | `list[EvaluationResult]` or `EvaluationSummary` |
| File output | Automatic | Optional via `OutputHandler.save()` |
| Use case | Standalone runs, CI jobs | Library integration, notebooks, scripts |

    └── evaluation_20251028_143000_status_breakdown.png
```

### CSV File (Detailed Results)

Contains every metric evaluation with:
- Conversation group ID and turn ID
- Metric identifier
- Score, threshold, status (PASS/FAIL/ERROR/SKIPPED)
- Detailed reasoning
- Query and response text
- Execution time
- API latency

**Use for:** Drilling into specific failures, detailed analysis

### JSON File (Summary)

Contains:
- Overall statistics (pass/fail/error counts)
- Per-metric summaries
- Score distributions (mean, median, std dev)
- Execution metadata

**Use for:** Quick overview, automated processing, tracking trends

### TXT File (Human-Readable)

Example:
```
EVALUATION SUMMARY
==================
Total Evaluations: 10
Passed: 8 (80.0%)
Failed: 2 (20.0%)
Errors: 0 (0.0%)

METRIC BREAKDOWN
================
ragas:response_relevancy:
  Mean Score: 0.85
  Pass Rate: 90%
  
ragas:faithfulness:
  Mean Score: 0.78
  Pass Rate: 70%
```

**Use for:** Quick review, executive summaries

### Visualization Graphs

1. **Pass Rates Bar Chart**: Compare pass rates per metric
2. **Score Distribution Box Plot**: Shows score spread
3. **Conversation Heatmap**: Performance across conversations
4. **Status Breakdown Pie Chart**: Overall pass/fail/error distribution

**Use for:** Presentations, quick visual insights

### Interpreting Status

- **PASS** ✅: Score met or exceeded threshold
- **FAIL** ❌: Score below threshold
- **ERROR** ⚠️: Evaluation couldn't complete (missing data, API failure, etc.)
- **SKIPPED** ⏭️: Evaluation skipped due to prior failure (when `skip_on_failure` is enabled)

### Performance Metrics (API Enabled Only)

**API Latency**: Response time per API call with percentile stats (p50, p95, p99). Cached responses (zero tokens) are excluded to avoid skewing statistics.

**Streaming Metrics**: Time-to-first-token, streaming duration, and tokens/second when using streaming endpoints.

**Token Usage**: Track consumption across Judge LLM, embeddings, and API calls.

**Note:** Cached responses are detected by zero `api_input_tokens` and `api_output_tokens` — latency is set to 0 for these.

### Score Quality Levels

| Score | Quality | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| 0.9 - 1.0 | Excellent | Production ready |
| 0.8 - 0.9 | Good | Typical threshold |
| 0.7 - 0.8 | Acceptable | Consider improvements |
| < 0.7 | Poor | Needs work |

### Pass Rate Interpretation

| Pass Rate | Status | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| ≥ 90% | Production ready | Deploy with confidence |
| 80-90% | Good quality | Minor improvements |
| 70-80% | Acceptable for testing | Needs improvement |
| < 70% | Not ready | Significant work needed |

# Part 4: Real-World Application

## 12. Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Quality Assurance for Customer Support Bot

**Scenario:** Launching a customer support chatbot

**Evaluation Strategy:**

1. Create test dataset with 50 common questions
2. Use metrics:
   - `ragas:response_relevancy` (0.8)
   - `ragas:faithfulness` (0.8)
   - `custom:answer_correctness` (0.75)

3. Configuration:
```yaml
- conversation_group_id: support_qa
  turns:
    - turn_id: password_reset
      query: "How do I reset my password?"
      contexts:
        - "Password reset: Click 'Forgot Password', enter email..."
      expected_response: "Use forgot password link and check email"
      turn_metrics:
        - ragas:response_relevancy
        - ragas:faithfulness
        - custom:answer_correctness
```

4. Success criteria:
   - Overall pass rate ≥ 90%
   - No faithfulness scores below 0.7
   - All high-priority questions pass

---

### Use Case 2: Regression Testing After Model Update

**Scenario:** Updating to a new AI model

**Strategy:**

1. Use existing production questions (100-500 samples)
2. Run evaluation on old model → Save results
3. Run evaluation on new model → Save results
4. Compare results

**Commands:**
```bash
# Evaluate old model
lightspeed-eval \
  --system-config config/system_old_model.yaml \
  --eval-data config/prod_samples.yaml \
  --output-dir ./results_old_model

# Evaluate new model
lightspeed-eval \
  --system-config config/system_new_model.yaml \
  --eval-data config/prod_samples.yaml \
  --output-dir ./results_new_model

# Compare results
uv run python script/compare_evaluations.py \
  results_old_model/evaluation_summary.json \
  results_new_model/evaluation_summary.json
```

5. Decision criteria:
   - New model must not decrease pass rate by >5%
   - Critical metrics must maintain or improve
   - Statistical significance test passes

---

### Use Case 3: Multi-Turn Troubleshooting

**Scenario:** AI guides users through complex troubleshooting

**Configuration:**
```yaml
- conversation_group_id: troubleshoot_deployment
  description: "Multi-turn deployment troubleshooting"
  
  conversation_metrics:
    - deepeval:conversation_completeness
    - deepeval:knowledge_retention
  
  turns:
    - turn_id: turn_1
      query: "My pod won't start"
      turn_metrics:

#!/bin/bash
# verify_namespace.sh
kubectl get namespace demo-app > /dev/null 2>&1
exit $?
```

**Success criteria:** 100% pass rate on critical operations

---

## 13. Best Practices

### 1. Start Small, Scale Up

❌ **Don't:** Start with 1000 questions and all metrics  
✅ **Do:** Start with 10-20 key questions and 2-3 core metrics

**Progression:**
- Week 1: 10 questions, 2 metrics
- Week 2: 50 questions, add metrics
- Month 1: 100-200 questions, full suite
- Production: 500+ questions

### 2. Choose the Right Metrics

| Scenario | Recommended Metrics |
|----------|---------------------|
| Customer Support (Single Q&A) | response_relevancy, faithfulness, answer_correctness |
| Multi-turn Conversations | conversation_completeness, knowledge_retention |
| Tool-calling Agents | tool_eval, response_relevancy |
| Infrastructure Automation | script:action_eval, tool_eval |

### 3. Set Realistic Thresholds

| Metric Type | Threshold | Use Case |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Production-critical | 0.85 - 0.95 | Customer-facing |
| Standard quality | 0.75 - 0.85 | General use |
| Beta/Testing | 0.70 - 0.75 | Testing phase |
| Binary metrics | 1.0 | Must match |

### 4. Create a Diverse Test Set

**Distribution:**
- 80%: Common, expected queries
- 15%: Edge cases
- 5%: Negative cases (should refuse/clarify)

### 5. Version Control Your Configurations

**Track in Git:**
- ✅ `system.yaml`
- ✅ `evaluation_data.yaml`
- ✅ Verification scripts
- ✅ Expected responses

**Don't track:**
- ❌ API keys
- ❌ Output files
- ❌ Cached results

### 6. Automate and Integrate

**CI/CD Example:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ai_evaluation.yml
name: AI Quality Evaluation

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  evaluate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Evaluation
        run: |
          uv sync
          lightspeed-eval \
            --system-config config/system.yaml \
            --eval-data config/evaluation_data.yaml
        env:
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

### 7. Regular Regression Testing

**Schedule:**
- Daily: Quick smoke tests (10-20 questions)
- Weekly: Full regression (100-500 questions)
- Before releases: Extended suite (1000+ questions)

### 8. Document Your Strategy

Create a README with:
- Evaluation goals
- Metric selection rationale
- Threshold justification
- Test set composition
- Success criteria

### 9. Handle Edge Cases

**Common edge cases:**
- Missing context → Should ask for more info
- Out-of-scope → Should politely decline
- Ambiguous queries → Should ask clarifying questions
- Multiple valid answers → Use broader thresholds

### 10. Cost Management

**Optimize Judge LLM costs:**

1. Use cheaper models when possible
```yaml
llm:
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"  # Instead of gpt-4o
```

2. Enable caching
```yaml
llm:
  cache_enabled: true
  cache_dir: ".caches/llm_cache"
```

3. Subset testing during development
   - Full suite: Weekly
   - Sample (10%): Daily
   - Critical questions: Per PR

---

## 14. Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "No API key found"

**Error:** `Error: OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not set`

**Solution:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"

# Verify
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Persist in shell profile
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### Issue 2: All Metrics Show ERROR

**Symptoms:** Status shows "ERROR" instead of PASS/FAIL

**Common causes & solutions:**

1. **Missing required fields**
```yaml
# ❌ Missing contexts for faithfulness
- turn_id: test1
  query: "Question"
  response: "Answer"
  turn_metrics:
    - ragas:faithfulness  # Needs contexts!

# ✅ Fixed
- turn_id: test1
  query: "Question"
  response: "Answer"
  contexts:
    - "Context document here"
  turn_metrics:
    - ragas:faithfulness
```

2. **Empty or null values**
```yaml
# ❌ Empty response
response: ""

# ✅ Provide actual response
response: "This is the answer"
```

**Field Requirements:**

| Metric | Required Fields |
|--------|----------------|
| response_relevancy | query, response |
| faithfulness | response, contexts |
| context_recall | contexts, expected_response |
| answer_correctness | query, response, expected_response |
| intent_eval | query, response, expected_intent |
| tool_eval | expected_tool_calls, tool_calls |
| action_eval | verify_script (API mode) |

---

### Issue 3: Low Faithfulness Scores

**Symptoms:** Faithfulness scores consistently below threshold

**Diagnosis:** Check CSV for reasons like "claims not supported by context"

**Solutions:**

1. **Add more context documents**
```yaml
contexts:
  - "Document 1 about topic A"
  - "Document 2 about topic B"
  - "Document 3 with more details"
```

2. **Adjust prompt to stick to facts**
```yaml
api:
  system_prompt: "Only use information from the provided context.
                  If information isn't in the context, say so."
```

---

### Issue 4: Inconsistent Results

**Symptoms:** Same question gets different scores each time

**Cause:** Non-zero temperature (randomness)

**Solution:**
```yaml
llm:
  temperature: 0.0  # Zero for deterministic evaluation
```

---

### Issue 5: Evaluation is Very Slow

**Solutions:**

1. **Increase concurrency**
```yaml
core:
  max_threads: 50
```

2. **Enable caching**
```yaml
llm:
  cache_enabled: true
```

3. **Use faster model**
```yaml
llm:
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"
```

---

### Issue 6: Script Execution Failed

**Solutions:**

1. **Check permissions**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/verify.sh
```

2. **Verify path**
```yaml
# Relative path from eval data file
verify_script: "./scripts/verify.sh"

# Or absolute path
verify_script: "/full/path/to/verify.sh"
```

3. **Test manually**
```bash
./scripts/verify.sh
echo $?  # Should be 0 for success
```

4. **Ensure API mode enabled**
```yaml
api:
  enabled: true  # Required for scripts
```

---

### Issue 7: Tool Evaluation Always Fails

**Solutions:**

1. **Check format**
```yaml
# ✅ Correct (list of lists of dicts)
expected_tool_calls:
  - - tool_name: oc_get
      arguments:
        kind: pod

# ❌ Wrong
expected_tool_calls:
  tool_name: oc_get  # Missing list structure
```

2. **Use regex for flexible matching**
```yaml
expected_tool_calls:
  - - tool_name: oc_get
      arguments:
        namespace: "openshift-.*"  # Regex pattern
```

---

### Issue 8: Out of Memory

**Solutions:**

1. **Reduce batch size**
```yaml
core:
  max_threads: 10  # Lower from 50
```

2. **Process in smaller batches**
```bash
# Split evaluation data into smaller files
lightspeed-eval --eval-data config/eval_batch1.yaml
lightspeed-eval --eval-data config/eval_batch2.yaml
```
